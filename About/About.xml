		<v1.5>Race Description:
Cutebolds are a race of adorable, cute little creatures descended from kobolds. The little 'bolds are content to dig, garden, and otherwise enjoy life in their separate tribes. They do not care much about outsiders and try their best to avoid confrontation, but out here on the rim, there is no such thing as peace.

Cutebolds love to dig; it is in their DNA! Having evolved from your typical kobold, they enjoy all sorts of digging and are able to get more resources out of the minerals they mine. They also have come to love working their gardens; it contains some digging after all! Their small hands allow them to be extra careful with harvesting and can get that little bit extra from their plants in doing so.

Cutebolds have the inherent ability to become adapted to living in the dark, allowing them to work just as fast, if not faster, in a dark cave as a human in a well-lit room. They are resilient to both psychic events along with having some resistance to toxicity; however, their resilience to psychic events means their abilities with psionic powers are decreased.

Just do not expect these little 'bolds to be overly fast at making buildings, they are rather quite short after all. Along with being short, they just cannot carry as much as a human could due to their strength. Additionally they are a simple race; their ability to research is not the best and it shows in their speed.


Mod Information:
This is an updated version of the Cutebold Race from Mister Manson. Sadly, the original version is no longer on the workshop. I decided to bring the race up to version 1.1+ along with adding a number of changes and tweaks. Since then, quite a bit has been added and the cutebold race has been fleshed out.

There are settings for the cutebold race in the Mod Settings menu. These allow you to disable the extra yield from mining/plant gathering, dark adaptation, eye glow, and detachable body parts. With this, the separate zip files for simplified heads and tails are gone.

For the descriptions in game, I decided to put the cutebolds’ character into the writing. I wrote them as though I was a scribe, taking their ramblings and writings and making them available for everyone. This is why most of the backstories and different cutebold related descriptions are simple and silly.


Latest Updates:
2.3.27 -- May 2, 2024
Changes:
- Rebalance of backstory stats

Fixes:
- Fixed the Refugee scenario

Additions:
- Special silhouette for Cutebold pawns when zoomed out

Developer Addition:
- Allow HAR to not error on HotReload.

2.3.26 -- Apr 11, 2024
- Built against latest versions of HAR and Rimworld 1.5

2.3.25 -- Mar 19, 2024
- Initial update to 1.5, Dev version of HAR Required for use in that.
- Major refactoring of some code


Feedback:
If you have any suggestions or feedback, do let me know! I know there are a plethora of mods that may create strange or undesirable effects.

		</v1.4>
		<v1.3>If your cutebolds have messed up prostetics and/or other hediffs due to the recent update, there is now a button under the Cutebold Race Settings when Dev Mode is enabled that you can click to hopefully fix the issue. Only do this once per savegame that has the hediffs messed up due to tongues being added.

- Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering
- Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering - Forked
- Children and Pregnancy


Known Issues:
- Children and Pregnancy: Two things; first, a large pink square may show up if your toddler grows into a child. This happens because the beanies and onesies don’t have a texture for children older than toddlers since they normally can’t put on those clothing items. Second, Children and Pregnancy is slightly buggy, your children might grow up with the wrong body shape. This seems to happen to the humans as well.
- Bionic icons: The fake cutebold tail does not show the tail icon for some reason.

What has been added since the 1.0 version?
- Backstories! Cutebolds now have their own backstories that reflect their simple lives. Those cutebolds who had a normal childhood are able to psylink with anima trees (if you have the Royalty DLC that is).
- Ears have been separated from the bodies and will disappear if they are lost.
- Cutebolds now have tails that also are separate from the bodies. There are recipes for creating replacements tails along with a rather rare, and prohibitively expensive, tail to purchase.
- Females now have can have a different body type from the males along with both genders having added body textures.
- Tweaked stats.
- More names that we cannot pronounce.
- A new scenario.
- Other non-kobolds do not taste too shabby...

Mod Support:
- Combat Extended *1*
- Children and Pregnancy *2*
- Children, schools, and learning
- Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering (EPOE)
- Rah’s Bionics and Surgery Expanded (RBSE)
- Bionic icons *3*

Known Issues:
- *1* With combat extended enabled, the cutebold scenario will throw errors when your pawns are downed and a stranger in black tries to spawn. Need to look farther into this; some other races have the issue while others do not? The issue seems to be caused by apparel according to the error.
- *2* Two things: First, a large pink square may show up if your toddler grows into a child. This happens because the beanies and onesies don’t have a texture for children older than toddlers since they normally can’t put on those clothing items. Second: Children and Pregnancy is slightly buggy, your children might grow up with the wrong body shape. This seems to happen to the humans as well.
- *3* The fake cutebold tail does not show the tail icon for some reason.
