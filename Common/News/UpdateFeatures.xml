			Latest update brings the mining yield for cutebolds above and beyond what a simple human can do. Cutebolds now can exceed the mining yield cap of 125% and can reach upwards of 147%!|

			Additionally the mod now allows for full translation support, with Japaneese 日本語 being the first translation.

		<content>Small update for those of you who have issues with prosthetics and/or hediffs on the wrong bodypart after the last mod update.|

			A button has been added under the Cutebold Race Settings that will move the various hediffs back to where they should be. This is only visible when dev mode is enabled.|

			This should only be run on a save that has not been played after the last update; otherwise newly added hediffs will be moved to an incorrect bodypart.</content>
