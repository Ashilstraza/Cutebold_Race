		<description>Used to living in the dark for a long time. Can see everything better with no light!\n\n
Scribe's Note: Adaptation increases naturally when a cutebold is in the darkness (under 30%) and decreases when in bright light (over 50%). It neither increases nor decreases when in areas lit by normal lamps and torches. When out on a caravan, a cutebold's dark adaptation will decrease over time due to traveling out in the sunlight.\n
There are four stages of dark adaptation:\n  -None: Default global work speed.  (100% light/80% darkness)
  -Minor: Global work speed in the darkness is equal to that in the light.  (90%/90%)\n  -Major: Global work speed is opposite what the default is.  (80%/100%)
  -Complete: Global work speed is even faster in the darkness.  (65%/115%)\n
A cutebold who is becoming adapted to the darkness will experience light sickness when in bright lights when their level is at minor and above. This increases in severity alongside the adaptation. Wimps who are adapted to the darkness should avoid bright light.

If extra harvesting yield is enabled, then cutebolds who are mining get more from the resources they mine depending on their adaptation:
  -None: 3.75% extra.\n  -Minor: 7.5% extra.\n  -Major: 11.25% extra.\n  Complete: 15%</description>

		<description>The bright light makes me feel bad.\n\n
Scribe's Note: Cutebolds who are adapted to the darkness experience light sickness when in bright light. This persists for a little while after leaving the bright light.\n
There are three stages of light sickness:\n  -Minor: -10% sight.\n  -Major: -25% sight and +10% pain.\n  -Complete: -50% sight, +20% pain, and -10% conciousness.\n
Note: Percentages for pain when hovering over the hediff are lower than what is on the health tab summary. This is due to body size having an effect on pain.</description>
